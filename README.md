# Advanced-Python-Calculator
This is a 1 operation Python calculator that I've made long ago ...
Check "Browse Code" to see it.
Basically what it does , it asks the user to enter 2 float variables and 1 sign which is a sting variable
it then tries and expects an error to prevent the user from crashing the code
after that with 4 ifelse conditions it detects what operation is being used and uses it on the 2 float variables
Finally it asks the user if he wants to reuse the calculator
if the user answers "yes" the code repeats and the while loop doesn't break.
